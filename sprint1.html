      <p>My name is Trevon Nelson, I was born and raised within
        Chicago Illinois. I am still a current resident of the area
        and I have been interested in tech for a long time. Technology
        interests started from gaming for me. From gaming and animation I
        learned alot about life without physically being in situations myself 
        which made me think of what is known as VR today. Any animation to me were nothing 
        but a simulation of an alternative pathway in real life minus
        all the fictional elements within them.

      <h2>Tech Background</h2>
      <p>Originally I was intrigued by gaming t get into technology. I spent most of my life 
          eyes glued to a screen pressing buttons and watching the magic happen. Pressing X, B,
          or square would make a character move a specific way. This made me curious as to how 
          the hardware would be able to create this connection let alone maintain it. It wasn`t
          until my time with Year Up and Job corp that discovered that was essentially coding, and 
        that the hardware solely depended on the demands of the software, or the finished product.   </p>

    <section id="Programs">
      <h2>Programs</h2>
      <p>I started to pursue my career within Olive Harvey, however at the
        time I lacked the direction and the guidance to fully realise what I wanted to do.
        I was Only aware of names of certain objects. It wasnt until I left and ended up
        going to Job Corps that I figured out what exactly about the hardware. From there I heard about Year Up.
        After finishing Job Corps I then wen to Year Up and learned the value of networking in and 
        outside of coding. IT all together is a huge network of niches hat all work together,
        inspiring me more to learn much about it further.
